## About Me
I have been working for WCPSS for 20 years. I spent **18** years in the  _classroom_ and have been the **librarian/makerspace teacher** at [Buckhorn Creek Elementary School](https://www.wcpss.net/BuckhornCreekES) for the past 2 years. I enjoy making learning fun and relevant. I am a lifelong learner, just trying to keep up with my students.
